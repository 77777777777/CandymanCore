CandymanCore
============

A small FiddlerCore based https proxy in .NET to alter the JSON response from Candy Crush Saga

ALWAYS USE THE [X] BUTTON TO EXIT! This will disable the proxy in network settings.


NOTE: This proxy does not alter the game at the moment unfortunately, I'm still looking into it. 
The game does depend on the https response though, providing an empty or invallid/corrupt JSON response will display an error message.
Altering the JSON data doesn't alter the gameplay at the moment (e.g. increasing number of lives and/or moves) :(
